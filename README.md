## 4. Doctor Manual

### 1. Log-in and Registration of users (Doctors)
#### 1.1. Log-in View
When loading the application the user will see a log-in view to access their accounts, the application checks for a valid password and email.

</div>

#### 1.2. Registration View
If the user does not have an account they can create one by clicking on the button "sign up", if so a new view will appear for the user to register himself, the application checks all the parameter to not be empyty and to have the correct format.

</div>

Once the account parameters have been introduced and validated by the server before storing them as a new user in the data-base, a message pop-up will show up to indicate the result of the request to the server. This will return a message like "Doctor account created" or an error like "User already exists" if the email was used already as it can be seen in the next image.

-------------------------------
### 2. Main application menu 
#### 2.1. Insert Doctor ID View
Once the user logs-in a pop-up will be displayed for the doctor to identify himself as a real doctor, in this case the ID uses the format of 8 digits and a letter form a list, in reality this ID should be verify aginst a hospital data-base to validate the doctor authenticity. This pop-up will show up everytime the doctor logs-in until a valid ID is inserted, this blocks the application from continuing blocking the access to patients information.
